//Let's start off by converting Kelvin to Celsius
//This value will be constant so save it as such

const kevlin = 293;

//Celsius is similar to Kevlin, the only difference is that Celsius is always 273 degrees less than Kelvin
//Below is the conversion of Kelvin to Celsius

const celsius = kelvin - 273;
